BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) are two common graph traversal algorithms used in programming to explore or search through graph-like data structures.
BFS 
- Uses a Stack
- Goes as far as possible on each branch, then backtrack and find another unvisited branch
- Last In First Out
- Find shortest path from vertex A to vertex B

DFS 
- Uses a Queue
- Explore nearby vertex first
- First In First Out



BFS (Breadth-First Search):

1. BFS explores a graph by traversing all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level.
It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to visit.
The algorithm starts by visiting the initial vertex, enqueues its adjacent vertices, and then continues visiting the vertices in the order they were enqueued.
BFS is typically implemented using a while loop or a queue.
BFS guarantees that it visits all the vertices at the same level before moving to the next level.
It is commonly used for finding the shortest path, minimum spanning trees, or level-order traversals.
DFS (Depth-First Search):

2. DFS explores a graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
It uses a stack data structure (or recursion) to keep track of the vertices to visit.
The algorithm starts by visiting the initial vertex, pushes its adjacent vertices onto the stack, and then continues visiting the vertices by recursively exploring each adjacent vertex.
DFS explores the deepest vertices first before backtracking to visit other vertices.
It is typically implemented using recursion or an explicit stack data structure.
DFS is useful for tasks such as searching for connected components, topological sorting, detecting cycles, or finding paths in a graph.
