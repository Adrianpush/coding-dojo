Backtracking is a technique used in algorithm design and problem-solving to 
systematically explore all possible solutions to a problem by incrementally 
building candidates and abandoning those that fail to satisfy the problem's constraints.

1. Define the problem: Clearly define the problem and identify the constraints or conditions that need to be satisfied.

2. Identify the decision space: Determine the set of possible choices or decisions that can be made at each step.

3. Implement the backtracking function: Design a recursive function that explores the decision space and maintains a partial solution. The function should try different choices, update the partial solution, and recursively explore further until a valid solution is found or all choices have been exhausted.

4. Handle base cases: Specify the conditions for terminating the backtracking process. These could be reaching a valid solution, reaching an invalid state, or exploring all possible choices.

5. Make choices and backtrack: At each step, make a choice from the available options and proceed recursively. If the choice leads to an invalid state or violates the problem constraints, backtrack or undo the choice and try a different option.

6. Keep track of solutions: Maintain a data structure or variables to track the valid solutions or collect the desired output.

7. Continue exploring: Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all possible choices have been explored or a valid solution is found.
