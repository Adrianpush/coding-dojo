Both Stack and Deque (specifically LinkedList implementation) can be used as a stack in Java, as they provide the 
necessary methods to manipulate a stack (push, pop, peek, etc.). 
However, there are some important differences between these two data structures:

Origin and Design: Stack is a class in Java that comes from the old legacy Collection classes in Java, 
predating the Java Collections Framework. On the other hand, Deque is an interface in the Java Collections Framework, 
and LinkedList is a class implementing this interface. 
Using the Java Collections Framework is generally recommended over the older classes because of its better design 
and richer functionality.

Performance: In general, LinkedList provides better performance than Stack. The Stack class extends Vector, 
which is a synchronized (thread-safe) collection, so its methods carry some unnecessary overhead 
if you don't need thread-safety. 
LinkedList, on the other hand, is not synchronized, so it's usually faster in single-threaded scenarios.

Flexibility: Deque (and thus LinkedList) is more flexible than Stack. It allows elements to be added or removed at 
both ends (it can function as both a stack and a queue), whereas Stack only allows manipulation from one end.

Given these differences, it's usually recommended to use Deque over Stack for stack-related operations in Java when 
you don't need thread safety. If you need a thread-safe stack, consider using ConcurrentLinkedDeque or synchronizing 
a Deque manually, rather than using Stack.
