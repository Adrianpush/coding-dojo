The sliding window algorithm is a technique used to efficiently process subarrays or sublists of a given array or list. It involves maintaining a window (a fixed-size subset) that "slides" through the array or list, dynamically adjusting its boundaries as needed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the sliding window algorithm works:

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to define the boundaries of the window. Initially, both pointers point to the start of the array or list.

2. Slide the window to the right by incrementing the right pointer. This expands the window and includes a new element in the subarray or sublist.

3. Process the current window. Perform any necessary computations or checks on the elements within the window.

4. If the window satisfies a specific condition or requirement, update the result or take any desired action.

5. Slide the window to the right again by incrementing the left pointer. This removes the leftmost element from the window, effectively reducing its size.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the right pointer reaches the end of the array or list.
