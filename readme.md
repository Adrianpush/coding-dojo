# Coding Dojo Repository

This repository is dedicated to my relentless pursuit of sharpening my programming skills, specifically in Java. It houses my solutions and explorations across a variety of coding platforms such as Codeforces, Codewars, and LeetCode. The main focus here is to practice and perfect problem-solving abilities.

In addition to solving problems, I am also deeply interested in freestyle coding and revisiting key programming principles. This involves revisiting and mastering various principles from Clean Code, such as:

- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- The Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

I will also be delving into various design patterns, lambda functions, multithreading, streams and general coding problems typically encountered in technical interviews.
